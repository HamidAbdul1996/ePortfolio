                                    <p> The Machine Learning Module has been a thought-provoking and valuable experience for my personal growth in data science. My goal in this reflection is to retrospect on the knowledge I have gained from learning and applying various machine learning algorithms, my contributions to the team projects, and the evolution of my personal/professional identity throughout this module. To guide my reflection, I will be using the reflective model developed by Rolfe et al. (2001). </p>

                                    <p> This module has significantly boosted my confidence and proficiency in applying unsupervised learning algorithms, especially K-means clustering. It has also introduced me to the realm of deep learning and artificial neural networks (ANNs), with a particular focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), an area completely new to me. A broader grasp of both unsupervised and supervised learning has only enhanced my real-world application skills, as different models excel in various domains. This understanding will aid me in better model selection and development (Sarker, 2021). The CIFAR-10 image classification project was an important moment in my learning journey. I had never engaged in such a project before, and the power and potential of machine learning in image classification fascinated me. I found this deeply motivational and wanted to learn as much as I could about ANNs. This led me to diversify my learning approaches, seeking knowledge from a variety of sources including YouTube, books, and the Internet. This approach helped me grasp the concepts more tangibly. I was also happy to get my first hands-on experience with TensorFlow. I had seen TensorFlow listed as a requisite skill in job adverts, and so I was very keen to learn its capabilities. Enhancing my technical skills will be beneficial for my career in data science, as employers seek candidates who are not only well-rounded but also proficient in the latest libraries and technologies (Smaldone et al, 2022).I am particularly excited about applying these newfound skills in future projects I am planning, such as emotion detection, and I am considering revisiting previous projects with a fresh perspective, employing neural networks where I previously relied on more conventional supervised learning techniques. I will also be completing a PyTorch project in my spare time so I can continually improve my deep learning capabilities. I want to make sure I am well-versed in deep learning. As we advance into Industry 4.0, employers will undoubtedly seek these skills, given their increasing prevalence (Li, 2022).</p>

                                    <p>In our unit 6 group project, I had a very positive experience with my team. It was my second group project at Essex; the first which was in a previous unit had its challenges. However, I learned from those challenges to improve my approach this time. Unlike before, where we worked separately on different sections leading to misalignment, we truly collaborated as a team in this project, ensuring our work was aligned before completing new sections. Studies have shown how strategic alignment can improve an organisation's performance (Gede, 2023), and I believe this extends to group work. In our group of three, everyone contributed significantly. When personal commitments arose for one member, others stepped in to keep us on track. We worked on each other strengths but also spent time explaining the things we had done to help each other. This division of labour allowed us to complete the report in a very timely manner. What stood out was our efficient communication; rather than lengthy calls, we used WhatsApp to stay in touch and ensure accountability, addressing an issue I encountered in a previous group.  Studies show that effective communication fosters excellent work and strengthens team unity, motivating everyone to perform their best (Eisenberg et al, 2019). Consequently, we achieved a high grade. Moving forward, I’ll ensure that if I am working on any collaborative task, the team objectives will be aligned and there will be regular communication through multiple channels, not just meetings. This saves time and makes sure the work is of a high standard.  </p>

                                    <p> In terms of my contributions, I felt like I led on the coding. I was quite fortunate in that I was in between jobs at the time so I was able to contribute more significantly. I managed the data cleaning, visualisation, and unsupervised learning tasks, then shared my work for review. My teammates enriched the analysis with additional charts and insights. As I had a background in data science, I spent time going through the code and talking about each part e.g. I spent time explaining K-means clustering and its mechanics as they were not familiar with it. I enjoy doing this as I believe teaching is one of the best methods of learning and studies have shown students who can teach/help others experience more persistent learning gains (Fiorella & Mayer, 2013). For the report writing, we collaborated closely, finding value in meeting together for this phase. This approach enabled real-time feedback and editing, enhancing the clarity and quality of our collective work.</p>

                                    <p> This module has significantly impacted my personal and professional growth, providing me with an essential, albeit introductory overview of neural networks. I feel like I now have a solid understanding of all the main branches of data science. Previously, mentions of PyTorch and TensorFlow in job descriptions deterred me from applying. Now, with a foundational understanding of these technologies, I'm encouraged to delve deeper into the subject. I feel more confident in my ability to comprehend the requirements of job applications in this field. This module has certainly ignited my interest in neural networks, and this is driven by their potential and versatility. I feel very motivated to become proficient with it. I currently work in the public sector and use unsupervised learning to predict local borough bankruptcies. I plan to explore how neural networks could enhance our models. In the future, I think I might want to specialise in neural networks, I am attracted by their capacity for creativity and their dynamics. It is also constantly evolving and I very much value working at the forefront of technological advancement. </p>

                                    <p>In conclusion, the module has significantly enhanced my data science capabilities and professional identity. Through mastering unsupervised learning algorithms like K-means clustering, and delving into deep learning and CNNs, my confidence and skill set have expanded. The hands-on experience with TensorFlow and the exploration of neural networks have not only prepared me for the evolving demands of the job market but also sparked a profound interest in pursuing neural networks further. I've also seen firsthand how crucial teamwork is in collaborative efforts to reach high standards of work. </p>
