										<h1>Training an Artifical Neural Network</h1>

                                    <h4><u> Read the article by Mach (2021) and pick one area that interests you or you have experience with. Note down your views on the use and impact of ANN on the selected area.</u></h4>
									<p>
                                        I'm fascinated by the potential impact of ANNs on talent acquisition and scouting within the sports industry. It seems to me that scouting involves numerous human factors, such as a player's mindset and background, which could pose significant challenges for a machine to adequately consider and integrate into its analysis. However, it can also bring many advantages to data analysis such as being able to process data from a multitude of sources quickly that a human would struggle to do including game statistics, player performance in various conditions, physiological data, and even social media activity. Human scouts may also have biases or preferences that can influence their evaluations. I think with enough training data, an ANN could potentially scout promising talent from very early on and can allow teams to nurture and develop players perfectly. This has already been happening in many sports.
                                        Musa et al. (2019) demonstrated the effectiveness of employing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and k-nearest neighbour classification models in the scouting of high-performance archers. Their research revealed that certain performance-related parameters could accurately determine the quality of an archer's performance. The study highlighted that ANNs are capable of predicting the class of archers with a high degree of accuracy based on key parameters. This breakthrough suggests a significant potential for saving resources, time, and energy during talent search programs, indicating a promising avenue for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of scouting processes in sports.
                                        Additionally, by using data on player development and success stories, ANNs can predict the future performance of athletes. This capability could perhaps help scouts identify players, who although may not be standout performers at the moment, possess the potential to excel in the future (Blackwood, 2023).

                                <h4><u>Read the snapshot paper by the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation on AI and Personal Insurance. As a customer, note down your concerns about use of AI in personal insurance. </u></h4>
                                <p> 
                                    I would be concerned about using AI in personal insurance, particularly regarding the assumption that the data underpinning these systems is impartial. History has repeatedly shown that data can both underrepresent and misrepresent minority groups, potentially leading to biased outcomes. Norori et al. (2021) highlight in their report the presence of bias in healthcare data concerning underrepresented groups.  For instance, minorities might face unjustly higher premiums based purely on their racial background, and this would of course be very unfair. 
                                    Furthermore, even in cases where certain demographics are statistically more likely to file insurance claims, it seems unjust to charge higher charges on individuals within these groups based on broad generalisations. An individual from such a group might be extremely cautious and never necessitate a claim, yet they could still face higher prices merely due to their demographic affiliation. I think insurance assessments and pricing should focus on factors within an individual’s control, ensuring fairness and equity. 
                                    While I realise AI can offer considerable benefits, it's crucial to remember that it remains a tool without the capacity to fully grasp the complexities of human society. Its application in personal insurance should be as an aid rather than the sole decision-maker to prevent inherent biases from influencing outcomes.

                                <h4><u> Gradient Cost Function Activity</u></h4>
                                <p> The notebook for this activity can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/HamidAbdul1996/ePortfolio/blob/main/artefacts/Unit08%20Ex4%20gradient_descent_cost_function%20(1).ipynb" target="_blank" >here.</a></p>
                                <p> Gradient cost is a measure used in optimisation algorithms, particularly in gradient descent to determine the direction and magnitude of steps needed to minimise the cost function. The goal is to reduce the difference between the predicted and actual values, thus minimising the cost (Ruder, 2017).
                                    This task proved valuable once more, offering insights into fine-tuning parameters effectively while building the model. Below are my observations from modifying the iteration count and learning rate.
                                    Increasing the number of iterations gives the algorithm more opportunities to adjust the parameters toward their optimal values. However, you have to be careful as if you pick too few iterations, the algorithm may not converge to the best solution leading to a higher cost. On the other hand, too many iterations can lead to diminishing returns in improvement and unnecessary computation.
                                    The learning rate determines the size of the steps taken towards the minimum of the cost function. If the rate is too high, the algorithm might overshoot the minimum, causing divergence and possibly leading to an increase in cost. If it is too low, convergence to the minimum will be slow requiring more iterations. There's also a risk it gets stuck at a local minimum.
