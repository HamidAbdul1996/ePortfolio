                                   <p> The Research Methods and Professional Practice Module has been an invaluable experience for my personal growth in data science. My goal in this reflection is to retrospect on the knowledge I have gained from learning and applying different research methods/methodologies, completing my literature review and research proposal and the evolution of my personal/professional identity throughout the module. To guide my reflection, I will be using the reflective model developed by Rolfe et al (2001).</p>
                                   <p> Revisiting statistical analysis in this module served as a valuable reminder of the skills I had acquired in the previous Numerical Analysis module, with the key difference being the use of Excel instead of Python/R. While I was already well-versed in inferential statistics, working with Excel highlighted the importance of adaptability as a data scientist. The evolving nature of the data science field requires professionals to possess a diverse skill set, encompassing both technical and interpersonal abilities, and to actively engage in lifelong learning and adaptability to remain competitive in the job market (Smaldone et al, 2022). This module also underscored my natural inclination towards quantitative analysis. Although my comfort with numerical data stems partly from past academic success, I recognise that to progress as a data scientist, I need to embrace the value of qualitative analysis. Additionally, it is becoming increasingly important for data scientists to be comfortable working with qualitative and quantitative data as real-world applications often demand insights from both data types to achieve effective solutions (Tanweer et al, 2021). Furthermore, the growing significance of fields like Natural Language Processing (NLP) further emphasises the need for data scientists to be well-versed in both. I believe my hesitation with qualitative data is more due to a lack of experience than an inherent weakness, and I intend to proactively seek out qualitative-based projects to bridge this gap. In my spare time I plan to complete various NLP projects so I can become a more well-rounded data scientist. Additionally, when completing the statistical worksheets, I noticed a tendency to prioritise visualisation over detailed interpretation when conducting analyses. I actively challenged myself to provide thorough interpretations of the graphs, even though a well-designed visualisation should ideally convey the key insights. Going forward, I intend to foster a more critical approach to analysis, moving beyond passive interpretation. Being able to critically analyse information quickly and effectively is becoming increasingly important in the job market (Mihail, 2022). </p>
                                   <p> Moving on to the assessments, I had completed a literature review before in my UG studies. I acknowledge that my submission was not of a high standard, I agree with the feedback I received stating it was descriptive rather than critical in nature. This was primarily due to time constraints imposed by starting a new job, which limited my ability to dedicate sufficient time to the task. Nevertheless, the process of learning about different types of literature reviews and applying this knowledge to my research proposal and capstone project proved valuable. I find literature reviews to be an excellent tool for shaping research. Rather than starting with a narrow topic, I prefer to explore a broader area like misinformation, allowing the literature to guide me towards a unique and personally interesting research gap. Literature reviews are an excellent tool for shaping research, they help identify areas that require further investigation and also help shape methodologies (Kraus et al, 2022). Going forward, I will place a greater emphasis on critical analysis in all my work. For my capstone project, I will implement better time management practices, incorporating insights gained from the project management unit.  I intend to establish a structured project management methodology, potentially using the waterfall approach due to its clear phases, emphasis on planning and documentation, and suitability for data science projects with fixed deadlines (Aina et al, 2022, Mokhtar & Khayyat, 2022). This structured approach aligns well with my personal work style and will help ensure a successful outcome.</p>
                                   <p> In contrast to the literature review, I dedicated more time to the research proposal. This process proved invaluable; I tend to adopt a "learn as you go" approach to projects. However, gaining a deeper understanding of different research methods, methodologies, and even research philosophies provided a solid foundation and a clearer sense of direction. This knowledge helped me identify relevant data and literature quicker, ultimately saving significant time. I've realised that without a rough plan encompassing these aspects, research can quickly become overwhelming due to the sheer volume of information available. While I maintain a degree of flexibility, recognising that research can evolve as you delve deeper into the topic and data, having a preliminary framework is essential. For instance, in my proposal focused on detecting political misinformation on Twitter during British elections, I initially intended to use the Twitter API. However, I soon discovered the limitations imposed by API restrictions and the laborious task of manually labelling tweets. Consequently, I shifted my approach to leverage existing secondary data. Such adaptations are inevitable, as it's impossible to anticipate all research challenges beforehand (McArdie, 2022). So, for my capstone project, I will set distinct frameworks and methodologies, but I will approach my research with fluidity. </p>
                                   <P> This module has significantly impacted my personal and professional growth, providing me with a comprehensive overview of research methods and professional practice. I now feel confident embarking on my capstone project, whereas before I was uncertain.  Additionally, while writing research papers was never a personal aspiration, I am pleased to have gained knowledge of the process, should the opportunity or desire arise. I am now more comfortable scoping new research topics, having overcome the initial feeling of being overwhelmed by the prospect of finding unique research areas. I understand how existing literature can guide and shape research endeavours. I am highly motivated to begin my project, having been pursuing my MSc for nearly two years and eagerly anticipating the final stage. Although my literature review focused on misinformation, I intend to align my capstone project with the financial services industry, which is my desired career path.  As a data scientist in the public sector, I am confident that the research methodologies and methods I've learned will be directly applicable to projects within my current role.</P>
                                   <p>In conclusion, the Research Methods and Professional Practice module has significantly enhanced my capabilities as a data scientist. I am now equipped with a deeper understanding of research methodologies, a refined skillset, and a heightened awareness of the importance of adaptability and continuous learning.  These newfound abilities will undoubtedly serve me well in the remainder of my academic journey, my capstone project, and my career in the ever-evolving field of data science. </p>
