										<h1>Evaluation Development Team Project</h1>
									</header>
                                    <p>Reflecting on the Unit 6 team project, I found the experience of collaborating with fellow students to complete the project both enjoyable and enriching. Although the project was relatively straightforward, it gave us valuable hands-on experience in data preprocessing, visualisation, and the application of unsupervised learning techniques to develop a model. My prior theoretical knowledge of unsupervised learning, particularly K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), was significantly enhanced by the practical challenge of constructing and deploying an unsupervised learning model. Moreover, the constraint of a 1000-word count presented an excellent opportunity to practice condensing complex data science concepts, a skill that is crucial for effectively communicating with non-technical colleagues in the professional world. </p>
                                    <p> Regarding team dynamics, I believe I took on a leadership role in the coding aspects of our project, largely due to my background in data science and my familiarity with unsupervised learning techniques. However, my learning was significantly enriched by my peers' contributions. One team member, with a software engineering background, brought a keen eye for the aesthetics of our notebooks and also taught me about other unsupervised algorithms he had come across in his career e.g. DBSCAN. The other student took charge of creating the template of the report which he seemed to have much experience off. The way he formatted the paper made it extremely easy to follow and it is something I will do with my work going forward. For example, I would often keep reports very minimal, but he showed me how to effectively add a content page and a cover page.</p>
                                    <p> This collaboration marked a stark improvement over my previous group project experiences, and I think this was echoed by our high grades. Our team thrived on valuable contributions from each member without the necessity for frequent meetings. Instead, we maintained a WhatsApp group chat for ongoing discussions, updates, and support. The experience showed me teamwork isn’t always about having lots of meetings and discussions (which is sometimes better) but working to each other's strengths and skills. </p>
