										<h1> Deciphering Big Data </h1>
									</header>
									<h2>In this module, we’ll explore the diversity of different data types, sources and methods of data collection. You will also develop an understanding of the process of data wrangling from collection to publishing and the ability to identify resources to undertake the data wrangling process. These processes are essential because it improves the quality of data by transforming the data collected in the raw state to a more usable format for a variety of applications by eliminating uneccessary duplications and redundancies of data items through processes such as cleansing and normalisation.</h2>

									<h3>Initial Post</h3>
									<p> The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionised the way we interact with our surroundings by enabling the collection of extensive data from a multitude of connected devices. With its transformative potential, the IoT has the capacity to revolutionise industries and enhance various aspects of our daily lives.

In contrast to conventional data collection methods that typically rely on sporadic or manual gathering, IoT devices offer a continuous flow of data. This real-time stream of information empowers organizations to make prompt and well-informed decisions, enabling them to swiftly adapt to evolving circumstances and base their actions on data-driven insights (Kumar et al, 2019).

Moreover, the IoT enables the collection of a wide range of data types, encompassing numerical measurements, texts, images, audio, video, and beyond. This diverse array of data empowers multidimensional analysis, enabling the exploration of correlations and patterns that may remain concealed when relying solely on traditional data sources (Abu-Elkheir et al, 2013).

However, the IoT also introduces inherent risks and challenges when it comes to large-scale data collection. IoT devices have the capacity to collect and transmit sensitive information, including personal and confidential data. The interconnected nature of IoT systems, coupled with potential vulnerabilities in devices, can make them susceptible to cyber-attacks, potentially resulting in privacy violations and breaches of confidentiality (Kumar et al, 2019).

Furthermore, the collection of IoT data heavily depends on sensors and devices that are susceptible to errors or malfunctions. Depending on flawed data can result in inaccurate analysis, flawed decision-making, and potential risks to operational processes. It is crucial to address and mitigate these challenges to ensure the reliability and integrity of the collected data for effective utilisation (Kumar et al, 2019).

Balancing the opportunities of IoT data collection with these risks necessitates robust security measures, stringent privacy protection, and the mitigation of potential errors in data collection. Organisations and individuals must prioritise data integrity, privacy, and ethical considerations when deploying and utilising IoT technologies.</p>

									<h3> Summary post </h3>

									<p> Upon reflecting on my initial post and considering the insightful contributions from my peers, I have gained a broader perspective on the challenges, issues, risks, limitations, and opportunities associated with data collection and the Internet of Things (IoT). Below, I will summarise the main points discussed:</p>

<p>Oppurtunities:</p>

<li>The IoT has revolutionised our interaction with the environment by enabling the collection of diverse data from numerous devices. This continuous flow of data empowers organisations to make prompt and well-informed decisions, adapting to evolving circumstances based on data-driven insights (Kumar et al., 2019).</li>

<li>IoT facilitates the collection of various data types, including numerical measurements, texts, images, audio, video, and more Abu-Elkheir et al, 2013.</li>

<p>Challenges:</p>

<li>Large-scale data collection through the IoT raises inherent concerns regarding privacy and data security. As mentioned in our posts, potential solutions to address these concerns include regulatory compliance, user control and access, and industry collaboration.</li>

<li>Sensors and devices used in IoT systems are susceptible to errors or malfunctions, leading to inaccurate data analysis. External factors can also compromise data integrity, resulting in the need for costly data cleaning.</li>

<p>One of my peers astutely pointed out the necessity of adapting data architecture models for IoT. Three examples of adaptable data architecture models are Kappa, Lambda, and Cloud Computing architecture. Notably, Kappa architecture has already been tailored for smart farming applications (Penka et al, 2021).

Achieving a balance between the opportunities presented by IoT data collection and the associated risks requires implementing robust security measures, stringent privacy protection, and effective mitigation strategies for potential data collection errors. It is essential for organisations and individuals to prioritise data integrity, privacy, and ethical considerations when deploying and utilising IoT technologies.</p>

									<h3>MICROKERNAL LEAST-PRIVILEGE-TEAM RESPONSE</h3>
									
									<p>In 2022, microkernel architectures offer superior stability and reliability to monolithic systems by modularising operating system processes (Foote, 2021; Fritzsch et al., 2019). However, Linus Torvalds rightly points out that an academically superior solution is useless when it is poorly developed, does not adhere to standards, and lacks community support (DiBona et al., 1999). Linux communities abound, and Linux has served as the underlying technology behind popular operating systems such as Android and ChromeOS due to its portability and ability to maximise system performance (Hoffman, 2017; Vaughan-Nichols, 2019). Linus Torvalds also acknowledges that the merits of system architectures reflect the technologies available (DiBone et al., 1999). With the era of quantum computing fast approaching, monolithic architectures may re-emerge as the best way to harness new-found computational power until another advancement enables better distribution of processing tasks; alternately, the inverse could also be true (Khan et al., 2022).</p>

									 <h3>A reflection of the development process based on your learning in this module, as well as your experience as a member of a development team (e.g., work allocation, experience of different roles, experience of team meetings and so on). </h3>
									 <p>Throughout this module I worked as part of the team of least privilege with Rob, Tinashe, Aaron and James. We initially worked on a design document for our secure web application called ‘First4Aid’, and following this, over a number of weeks we built the application and worked towards our presentation demo back to our tutor. While initially I was nervous about being part of a team, I quickly realised so much was to be gained and I was very lucky with the team that I worked with. 
<p>I put faith into my skills as a business analyst and lead a requirements session on the 01 July. On this session I focused on the WHAT (what are we building) and the WHY (why do we need it). We also spent some time on this call working on a mind map. Essentially, we mapped a brain dump of the requirements we felt our application would need, alongside closely keeping an eye on the assignment security requirements. This aided us with staying on track as we moved through development. 
We prioritized our features using the MoSCoW method. Must have / Should have / Could have / Will not have. </p>
										 
<p>We discussed what tools we would use to aid us in communicating and keeping on schedule. We agreed on Trello for planning and dividing tasks, Teams for communication, and Confluence for document collaboration.
We decided to make 2PM every Friday our regular time slot to catch-up. This gave us structure to our studies and time to dedicate to our team project.</p>
<p>As part of the development, I also enjoyed helping out with test scenarios. I used the BDD style of GIVEN WHEN THEN to help us test the First4Aid application.
Throughout the last number of weeks, I have learnt a lot from working with my team. I learnt what my strengths were in a team dynamic and where I need to improve.   </p>
