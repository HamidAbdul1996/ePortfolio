										<h1> Deciphering Big Data </h1>
									</header>
									<h2>In this module, we’ll explore the divresity of different data types, sources and methods of data collection. You will also develop an understanding of the process of data wrangling from collection to publishing and the ability to identify resources to undertake the data wranglinh process. These processes are essential ebcause it improces the quality of data by transforming the data collected in the raw state to a more usable format for a variety of applications by eliminating uneccessary duplications and redundancies of data items through processes such as cleansing and normalisation.</h2>
									
									<h2> Summarising this modules studies: </h2> 
									<ul style=“list-style-type:square”>

<li> In Week one we learned about different approaches to software development, focusing on implications of secure software. </li>

<li> In Week two we looked at UML diagramming, and the benefits of this documentation towards software development.</li>

<li>In Week three we focused on programming language, with a particular focus on reviewing the history and concepts of programming languages. </li>

<li> In Week four investigated and explored the effect of key programming concepts on system security. We focused on two concepts in particular: regular expressions and recursion.</li> 

<li> In Week five we explored testing software both for general quality and, specific to this module, for security.</li>

<li> In Week six we looked at Python code development and particularly applying linters to support quality code development </li>

<li> In Week seven we discussed Operating Systems (OS) and their relationships to programming languages and security.</li>

<li> In Week eight we looked at Cryptography and Its Use in Operating Systems. </li>

<li> In Week nine we learned about developing an API for a Distributed Environment. </li>

<li> In Week ten we explored the evolution of system architectures, from distributed systems to microservices.</li>

<li> In Week eleven we looked at future trends in the areas of secure design, development, programming languages and operating systems. </li>

									<h3>Team Discussion: What is a Secure Programming Language? </h3>
									
									<p> 1. What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</p>
<p> Many languages are prone to issues because the languages haven’t been built with modern issues in mind (Pillai, 2017; Tung, n.d.; White Source Ltd., n.d.). For example, C is prone to error handling issues, whereas Python has built-in handlers that will stop the program in the event of faulty code (Tung, n.d.; White Source Ltd., n.d.).</p>

<p>PHP is prone to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) errors (a type of injection attack). As an early language designed for websites, the functionality did not keep up with the distributed nature of modules and code from open source software libraries (Php.net, 2019; Tung, n.d.; White Source Ltd., n.d.)</p>

<p>The general trend is that over time, environments and purposes for language use change. This presents new challenges not anticipated when the languages were originally created.</p>


<p>2. Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.</p>
<p>Due to its built-in error handling for many fatal errors and its track record to date, Python could be considered a relatively secure language (Pillai, 2017; Tung, n.d.; White Source Ltd., n.d.). It is not a perfect solution, and newer languages such as Rust extend Python’s security features even further through enhanced error reporting and memory management (Abiodun, 2022).</p>


<p>3. Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss.</p>
<p>Research indicates that Python is too slow to serve as an operating system language, and that a lower-level language like C would be more effective in this role (Abiodun, 2022). The downfall is that designing an operating system in C would likely require an extraordinary amount of testing to ensure stability and security.</p>

									<h3>MICROKERNAL LEAST-PRIVILEGE-TEAM RESPONSE</h3>
									
									<p>In 2022, microkernel architectures offer superior stability and reliability to monolithic systems by modularising operating system processes (Foote, 2021; Fritzsch et al., 2019). However, Linus Torvalds rightly points out that an academically superior solution is useless when it is poorly developed, does not adhere to standards, and lacks community support (DiBona et al., 1999). Linux communities abound, and Linux has served as the underlying technology behind popular operating systems such as Android and ChromeOS due to its portability and ability to maximise system performance (Hoffman, 2017; Vaughan-Nichols, 2019). Linus Torvalds also acknowledges that the merits of system architectures reflect the technologies available (DiBone et al., 1999). With the era of quantum computing fast approaching, monolithic architectures may re-emerge as the best way to harness new-found computational power until another advancement enables better distribution of processing tasks; alternately, the inverse could also be true (Khan et al., 2022).</p>

									 <h3>A reflection of the development process based on your learning in this module, as well as your experience as a member of a development team (e.g., work allocation, experience of different roles, experience of team meetings and so on). </h3>
									 <p>Throughout this module I worked as part of the team of least privilege with Rob, Tinashe, Aaron and James. We initially worked on a design document for our secure web application called ‘First4Aid’, and following this, over a number of weeks we built the application and worked towards our presentation demo back to our tutor. While initially I was nervous about being part of a team, I quickly realised so much was to be gained and I was very lucky with the team that I worked with. 
<p>I put faith into my skills as a business analyst and lead a requirements session on the 01 July. On this session I focused on the WHAT (what are we building) and the WHY (why do we need it). We also spent some time on this call working on a mind map. Essentially, we mapped a brain dump of the requirements we felt our application would need, alongside closely keeping an eye on the assignment security requirements. This aided us with staying on track as we moved through development. 
We prioritized our features using the MoSCoW method. Must have / Should have / Could have / Will not have. </p>
										 
<p>We discussed what tools we would use to aid us in communicating and keeping on schedule. We agreed on Trello for planning and dividing tasks, Teams for communication, and Confluence for document collaboration.
We decided to make 2PM every Friday our regular time slot to catch-up. This gave us structure to our studies and time to dedicate to our team project.</p>
<p>As part of the development, I also enjoyed helping out with test scenarios. I used the BDD style of GIVEN WHEN THEN to help us test the First4Aid application.
Throughout the last number of weeks, I have learnt a lot from working with my team. I learnt what my strengths were in a team dynamic and where I need to improve.   </p>
