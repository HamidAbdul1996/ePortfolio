										<h1>Unit 5: Interviews, Survey Methods, and Questionnaire Design</h1>
									</header>
                                    <h4><u> Initial thoughts</u></h4>
                                    <p>
                                        This unit was useful in that it introduced other ways to collect data including interviews. I think if I was not worried about time and resource constraints, I would want my capstone project to be using data from interviews but I will probably use statistical data or existing data because it saves time and resources. Surveys are incredibly useful in collecting data for sever reasons, first they can be easily distributed to a large number of people allowing researchers to gather data from diverse populations. Secondly surveys use a consistent set of questions, ensuring there is standardisation. Thirdly they are cost-effective, online surveys in particular (Ponto, 2015). I also learned about the importance of questionnaire design. The design is crucial because it directly impacts the quality, validity and reliability of the data collecting. Carefully worded questions and appropriate response options reduce the risk of misinterpretation and ensure respondents provide accurate information. Additionally engaging questionnaires will encourage respondents to complete them and finally, a well-structured questionnaire focuses on the specific research questions, ensuring that the data collected is relevant and useful for addressing the research objective (Yaddanapudi & Yaddanapudi, 2019).   
                                    </p>

                                    <H4><u>Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys</u></H4>
                                    <p> 
                                        In 2012, Target used purchase data to identify pregnant customers and send them targeted advertising.
                                        The retailer's algorithm analysed customers' shopping patterns and identified certain products, like unscented lotion and vitamins, that were often purchased by pregnant women. 
                                       Target's practice raises concerns about privacy invasion and the potential for discrimination. Collecting and analysing sensitive personal data without explicit consent can be seen as a violation of individual autonomy and dignity. This case sparked public outrage and eroded trust in the company. Consumers felt their privacy was violated, and the practice was perceived as manipulative and intrusive. While not explicitly illegal at the time, this case contributed to the growing debate around data privacy and consumer protection. It led to increased scrutiny of data collection practices and the development of stricter regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This case tarnished Target's reputation and raised questions about its corporate responsibility. It highlighted the need for businesses to prioritise ethical data practices and consider the potential impact of their actions on individuals and society (Forbes, 2016).
                                          
                                    </p>

                                <h4><u> Reflection</u></h4>
                                <p>
                                    On reflection, this unit has significantly broadened my understanding of data collection methods, highlighted the versatility of surveys while also introducing the nuanced complexities of interview technique. Surveys undeniably hold immense potential for gathering data from diverse populations, especially through cost-effective online platforms. However, the Target case study underscores the ethical tightrope researchers and businesses must walk when dealing with sensitive personal data. The fallout from Target's pregnancy prediction algorithm serves as a cautionary tale, emphasising the importance of obtaining explicit consent and safeguarding individual privacy.
Furthermore, the unit reinforced the critical role of questionnaire design in ensuring data quality and relevance. Carefully crafted questions and response options are essential to minimise misinterpretations and maximise respondent engagement. A well-structured questionnaire ensures that the collected data directly addresses the research objectives, a principle I'll carry forward in my academic and professional career.
