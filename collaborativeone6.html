										<h1>Collabrative Discussion: Case Study: Abusive Behaviour</h1>

									<h3>Review the application of the ethics code to the situation described and highlight the impact on any relevant legal (jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional) and social issues, as well as on the professionalism of the computing professionals involved </h3>
									<h4><u>Initial Post</u></h4>
									<p>  The BCS Code of Conduct comprises four key principles (BCS, 2024): </p>
                                        <p>
                                        <li> You make IT for everyone. </uli> 
                                        <li> Show what you mean, learn what you don't</li>
                                        <li> Respect the organisation or individual you work for</li>
                                        <li> Keep IT real. Keep IT professional. Pass IT on, </li> </li>
                                        </p>
                                        <p> The abusive behaviour case study demonstrates a clear violation of several of these tenets. </p>

                                           <li> You make IT for everyone. </li>

                                            <p> Max has a pattern of emotionally abusing and discriminating against his female colleagues. His habit of removing female team members from journal manuscripts and excluding them from presenting violates their rights to recognition, has a significant impact on their well-being and is discriminatory in general. These actions foster a toxic work environment that actively undermines equal access. Both Max’s and Jean's inaction damage the reputation of the profession and can have long-term consequences for attracting a diverse talent pool (Rassol et al, 2021). </p>
                                            <li>Show what you mean, learn what you don’t</li>
                                            <p>Max demonstrates a lack of emotional intelligence and personal/professional integrity. Despite his reputation, Max appears to lack a sense of emotional maturity. He has violated equality law, either through ignorance or indifference to his legal and ethical obligations. His behaviour prevents collaboration, and teamwork and undermines the profession. Jean’s failure to intervene further enables his behaviour, these actions underscore the negative impact of power imbalances and the importance of relational accountability in mitigating workplace injustice (Roscigno, 2019)</p>
                                            <li>Respect the organisation or individual you work for</li>
                                            <p>Max misrepresents his team's achievements by solely highlighting his contributions, he demonstrates a lack of respect for his colleagues and the organisation. He may have a desire for personal power which suggests a potential conflict of interest. By discriminating against women, he's also causing huge reputational and long-term damage to his organisation. </p>
                                            <li>Keep IT real. Keep IT professional. Pass IT on. </li>
                                            <p>Max's behaviour and Jean's complicity undermine the reputation of the IT industry. Their actions could deter talented individuals from entering the field due to its portrayal as a hostile environment. Their actions reflect an outdated mindset that disregards the development of ethics. Max does not seem interested in supporting his team members in their professional growth which will lead to less innovation in the field. </p>         
                                

                                
                                       
                                        <h4><u>Peer Response 1</u></h4>
                                        <p>Thank you for your insightful response, Michael. 
                                            The case study and your post raise an interesting point about digital vigilantism regarding cyber security. When law enforcement agencies are unable or unwilling to respond to cybercrime, organisations are increasingly questioning whether they have the right to hack back as a retaliatory measure.  There appear to be two trains of thought at the moment (Bloch et al, 2018):
											</p>
											<p>
												<li> Against Hack-Back: Opponents note the risks and potential for unintended consequences.</li>
												<li> Pro Hack-Back: Supporters argue that provided there is accurate attribution and proportionate response, it is the only realistic solution. </li>
											</p>
											<p>
												Legislation on hack-back is also evolving. In the UK, the Computer Misuse Act (CMA) makes it illegal to access a computer system without authorisation apart from some very narrow exceptions, so hack-back is generally not allowed. However, it appears there is a conflicting movement in the US. Legislative attempts like the Active Cyber Defence Certainty Act (ACDC) which has gone through several iterations are seeking to clarify when it may be permissible to hack back, while security and defence agencies want more aggressive responses to foreign attacks (SC Magezine, 2022). Ultimately, this case study highlights the importance of two points: having strong preventative cybersecurity measures in the first place to avoid needing to retaliate and working together across borders to tackle cybercrime.  As mentioned in the case study, Rogue was based in a country whose laws did not adequately proscribe such hosting activities.

                                            <h4><u>Peer Response 2</u></h4>
                                            <p>  Thank you for your insightful post, Shaun.
                                                The case study and your post raise an interesting point about deception laws regarding the legal implications of dark UX. To effectively protect consumers against the increasingly sophisticated and manipulative nature of dark patterns, it may be that legal frameworks and definitions need to change. Definitions need to be clear and reflect the technological advancements enabling these practices (Luguri & Strahilevitz, 2021). While the BCS Code promotes equality of access for people with disabilities, it could offer more specific guidance on avoiding dark patterns. These disproportionately impact those with disabilities and often exploit biases. Currently, it does have Section 1 which promotes the equality of access for people with disabilities but perhaps this should be more specific.  One article suggests the necessity for a more nuanced taxonomy of dark patterns, one that centres on the way they violate consumer autonomy which aligns closely with EU consumer law and its focus on protecting autonomy. This could be a powerful tool for both regulators and the BCS in promoting ethical design and protecting consumers. (Brenncke, 2023) 
                                                
                                                </p>
                                                <h4><u>Summary Post</u></h4>
                                                <p> Upon reflecting on my initial post and the post by my peers, it is clear that the BCS Code of Conduct isn't just a set of abstract principles but an important framework that guides our actions and shapes our industry.  In my initial post, I focused on the case study of abusive behaviour, highlighting the violation of several key tenets of the Code. The conversation around cybersecurity and "hacking back" highlighted organisations' complex ethical and legal dilemmas when facing cyberattacks. Additionally, there is an ever-changing legislative landscape around the world regarding cyber security centred around the ongoing debate on proactive defence versus the potential for unintended consequences (Bloch et al, 2018).  Additionally, we analysed the issue of dark patterns in user experience design This discussion highlighted the need for clearer legal definitions and stronger ethical guidelines to safeguard consumers, especially those with disabilities(Luguri & Strahilevitz, 2021).
                                                    These discussions and my original post demonstrate that the BCS Code of Conduct is a living guide that must continuously adapt to the evolving technological landscape. Its importance can not be understated as it serves as a moral compass, guiding ethical decision-making and professional conduct in the IT industry.  By adhering to its principles, we not only protect individuals and organisations but also uphold the integrity and reputation of our profession.
