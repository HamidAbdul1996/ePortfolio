                                    <h4><u> Initial thoughts</u></h4>
                                    <p>
                                        This unit was incredibly helpful in refreshing my knowledge of methodology, a topic I hadn't revisited since my undergraduate (UG) studies. Learning about research design was also beneficial, as it guided my literature review and ultimately shaped my research proposal. It is evident that research design acts as a roadmap for the entire research process and also ensures credibility (Asenahabi, 2019). 
                                        Furthermore, the unit introduced me to various methods of data collection and analysis, which proved invaluable for my proposal. By understanding these methods, I could allocate my resources more effectively, saving valuable time. Previously, the vast array of options had been overwhelming, but this unit clarified the landscape considerably.

                                    <H4><u> Research Proposal Review</u></H4>
                                    <p>
                                        Given that the project involves collecting tweets and analysing their content to understand political misinformation, a qualitative research design would be more suitable. While machine learning can be used to assist in the analysis, the primary focus is on interpreting the meaning and context of the tweets, which would make it qualitative. 

                                        For this project, I would primarily use primary data collection methods. This would involve collecting tweets directly from Twitter's API. I can also use secondary data by using existing datasets.
                                         
                                    </p>

                                    <p> To successfully complete the project, I will need the following skills:</p>

                                    <p>
                                        <li> Qualitative analysis: Ability to interpret and analyze text data to identify patterns, themes, and nuances related to political misinformation.</li>
                                        <li>Domain knowledge: Understanding of political discourse, social media communication, and the various forms of misinformation that can occur on Twitter.</li>
                                        <li> Data collection: Familiarity with Twitter's API or other tools to collect relevant tweets. </li>
                                        <li> Data preprocessing: Basic understanding of text cleaning and preparation techniques to organize the collected tweets for analysis.</li>

                                    The purpose of this journal article is to investigate the use of machine learning models to predict the outcomes of English Premier League football matches. The main problem it addresses is the difficulty in predicting the outcome of football matches due to the sports inherence unpredictability and the imbalanced nature of datasets (more wins than losses or draws). The objective is to assess the performance of different machine learning models for binary and multiclass classification and to evaluate their effectiveness in simulating football betting profits.

                                <p>
                                The research methodology involves training various machine learning models (random forest, logistic regression, linear support vector classifier, and extreme gradient boosting) on datasets created using different sampling techniques (stratified and balanced). The models are then evaluated using standard classification metrics (accuracy, F1 score, AUC) and by simulating betting profits based on the 2022-2023 EPL season.
                                The methodology is appropriate for the research question. The use of different sampling techniques is a standard approach to address imbalanced datasets, and the evaluation metrics are relevant for assessing classification model performance. The simulation of betting profits adds a practical dimension to the evaluation.

                                <p>
                                    The data collection process involves gathering historical EPL match data from multiple online sources, including match statistics, FIFA ratings, and betting odds. Feature engineering is performed to create relevant features for the models. The analysis includes feature selection techniques to identify the most impactful features.
The data collection and analysis methods are suitable for the research purpose. This is secondary data collection, collecting from archival data. These are historical games, so this is appropriate. The use of multiple data sources ensures a comprehensive dataset, and the feature engineering process is well-explained. The feature selection methods help to refine the models and improve their predictive power.

                                    he paper supports its claims and conclusions with clear arguments and evidence. It presents the results of the model evaluations, comparing their performance across different sampling techniques and classification types. The simulation of betting profits provides concrete evidence of the models' effectiveness in a real-world scenario. The authors also discuss the limitations of their approach, acknowledging the challenges posed by the imbalanced dataset and the reliance on FIFA ratings.
Enhance work
To improve the work, I would say the authors could expand the dataset to include data from lower tier games or even games outside of England. They could also explore additional features such as player specific data.

                                <p>
                                    The purpose of this research is to develop a machine learning model for fake news detection. The problem it addresses is the increasing prevalence of fake news and the difficulty of manually identifying it. The objective is to create a model that can automatically classify news articles as fake or not fake, using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms

                                    The research methodology involves collecting datasets of fake and real news articles, preprocessing the text data, extracting features using NLP techniques, and training and evaluating different machine learning classifiers (Passive Aggressive, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine). The models are evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, and recall in classifying news articles.
The methodology is appropriate for the research question. The use of multiple classifiers allows for a comparison of their performance, and the evaluation metrics are relevant for assessing the effectiveness of fake news detection models.

                                <p>
                                    The data collection process involves gathering news articles from two publicly available datasets: one from Kaggle and another from Signal Media. The datasets contain both fake and real news articles. The analysis includes preprocessing the text data (tokenization, stemming, stop word removal) and extracting features using techniques like Count Vectorization and TF-IDF.

The data collection and analysis methods are suitable for the research purpose. The use of publicly available datasets allows for reproducibility of the results, and the preprocessing and feature extraction techniques are standard practices in NLP for text classification tasks.

                                    The paper supports its claims and conclusions with explicit arguments and evidence. It presents the results of the model evaluations, comparing their performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. The authors also compare their results with previous studies, demonstrating that their approach achieves higher accuracy in some cases. They conclude that machine learning, combined with NLP techniques, can be effective in detecting fake news.

                                <p>
                                    I was well-versed in the different types of methodology and data collection, but it was still beneficial to cover this in this week's unit. The main advantage is knowing what data and literature I should be looking for and not wasting my time reviewing things that are not relevant to my research design. I have started writing my literature review this week, so I feel I am gaining a better understanding of this all. The Peer review was very helpful, it helped me see the variation in different methodologies and research design in different types of papers. I picked a few at random and compared and contrasted
