										<h1>The Data Professional</h1>
									</header>
									<p>As the 4th industrial revolution and 4th paradigm of science unfolds with the generation of data at unprecedented levels, it has become ever more important to create value from this big data. While creating value from big data, data scientists act as the key professional in this transformation and need to comply with the regulations on data use, as well as being mindful of individual privacy and, equally, the ethical use and reuse of data.

The module will explore and investigate the critical theoretical concepts in the discipline of data science, starting from data collection and then gradually leading to the stage where data is transformed into knowledge to support business decisions. You will be able to engage in this process and then evaluate a set of tools and techniques to be applied to pre-processed data in order to derive an effective solution.

Please note that for the various coding exercises in this module, you are encouraged to create GitHub repositories to save your work. If created, the repository link(s) should feature in your e-portfolio.

To help you utilise GitHub and also help with your development during your entire programme, please ensure you review the GitHub content on the department page and utilise the e-book provided in this module – Automating Workflows with GitHub Actions (available to you throughout your programme). Feel free to get in contact with your tutor about this valuable tool and share your hints and tips in the module wiki.

Finally, this module provides a high-level introduction/overview of the topics covered in greater detail in other modules of your postgraduate programme, as well as aspects you will encounter during your career in Data Science. You may find it useful to refer to the module contents regularly throughout your course.

In this module we shall:
Examine relevant industry practices of data science operations in order to build key skillsets for analysing and transforming large data sets in response to different business problems and to different needs.
Develop knowledge of fundamental programming concepts and problem-solving techniques used in data analysis, using suitable programming languages such as Python and SQL.
Develop an ethos of continuous professional development in the area of data science that enables the students to evaluate critically, design, and develop an effective data science system using contemporary tools and techniques.
Develop an understanding of the stakeholders’ perspective - consolidation of data sources, data preparation and aligning data to business objectives.
Develop an understanding of the cyber security risks that exist in the data management process.
Critically appraise the emerging trends, professional and ethical requirements for dealing with data science projects, and within which a Data Science professional must operate.
On completion of this module, you will be able to: </p>
