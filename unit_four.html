										<h1>Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn</h1>

                                    <p>
                                        Scikit-learn is an open-source machine-learning library for Python. It provides a variety of tools for data mining, data analysis and a range of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model section and preprocessing. It is built to interact with NumPy and SciPy and is renowned for its ease of use, performance, and documentation (Scikit-learn, 2024).

                                    <p>
                                        Over the last three units, I have learned about EDA, correlation, and regression. Reflecting on the challenges encountered, data cleaning stood out as a particularly demanding aspect of our work. The GDP and population datasets we used in the unit 4 seminar contained many missing values and inconsistencies, underscoring the often-noisy nature of data and the preparation required for machine learning algorithms. I originally put the instructions and the two CSV files into ChatGPT and asked it to complete as it seemed quite straightforward, but I found it was having trouble analysing the data due to the inconsistencies. ChatGPT has significantly streamlined much of my data cleaning and occasionally it can do this with minimum guidance however in this instance it was finding it difficult. I think it's still important to have a clear understanding of what you want to do with the data before as ChatGPT can clean the data in various ways, I find in instances like this I spend more time inspecting the data and then give clear focused prompts on what I want to do and ChatGPT provides the code. For example, instead of just asking ChatGPT to clean the data, I asked for the exact code that would replace missing values and any non-float with NaN and then remove countries which had 5 or more NaN values. In reflection, I think tools like ChatGPT offer fantastic guidance on cleaning data and it is useful to put in the baseline instruction to see how it would tackle the issue but I think it’s important to recognise that the user should still critically think about how they would like to clean data as sometimes ChatGPT may struggle or have a different interpretation on what needs to be done. Hassani (2023) has talked about the revolutionary role of ChatGPT in data science and how it can automate much of the data preprocessing process. ChatGPT also allows you to see different ways to code the same task which only helps my technical skills. 
Even though I didn't apply it in my project, my exploration into non-linear regression was eye-opening. Previously, I might have automatically leaned towards linear regression for any dataset. However, understanding non-linear regression has taught me the importance of not presuming linearity in the data I work with. The reality is that many datasets in the real world don't adhere to this linear pattern. This insight has bridged the gap between academic theory and practical application for me, highlighting that working with real-world data often involves navigating complexities and exceptions to theoretical assumptions.
