										<h1>Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</h1>
									</header>
                                    <p> In this unit, we were introduced to Convolutional Neural Networks. This was a very important module which shaped my Unit 11 presentation. CNN is a class of deep neural networks, highly effective in processing data with a grid-like topology such as images. They have convolutional layers that filter the images, pooling layers that reduce dimensionality and a fully connected layer which makes decisions based on the features extracted (Yamashita et al, 2018). </p>
                                    <h4><u>Read the Wall (2019) article and record your thoughts on the ethical and social implications of this CNN technology. </u></h4>
                                    <p>
                                        My primary concern would be around facial recognition technology. The article highlights how these models struggle with identifying people with darker skin, even misgendering their gender. If such technology were used in criminal identification, it could lead to significant social issues. This piece emphasises that ethnic minorities, already disproportionately represented in crime statistics, in England and Wales (Ministry of Justice, 2016) could be unjustly targeted due to AI bias. This is a scenario we must avoid. 
                                        Privacy concerns are valid too. It would be reassuring to see some form of consent built into the system. Additionally, the uncertainty around data storage and the potential for hacking raises significant worries, as personal data could become accessible to unauthorised parties. It may even be that laws need to be changed as studies have shown that existing laws are inadequate to regulate the use of facial recognition technology by government or commercial organisations (Sarabdeen, 2022). 
                                        Finally, I think when CNNs are employed in decision-making processes, the challenge of determining accountability for errors or biases will be difficult. The responsibility will be distributed among developers, data providers, and users which complicates legal and ethical accountability.   
                                         
                                    </p>
                                    <h4><u> Reflection</u></h4>
                                    <p> Reflecting on this unit has deepened my understanding of the challenges machine learning professionals face, particularly with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) technology. Through our exploration of facial recognition's complexities, I've come to appreciate both the technological advancements it offers and the significant concerns it raises. Issues such as data protection, privacy, and the potential for perpetuating biases have emerged as critical considerations. These technologies hold the power to reshape societal norms, leading to debates around surveillance and the potential for misuse.
                                        In my view, addressing the inherent biases within machine learning algorithms emerges as the most important concern. As professionals in this field, there's an inherent duty to ensure transparency around the capabilities and limitations of our models, underpinning our efforts with a commitment to accountability throughout the development and application phases. Those involved in creating and deploying CNNs face the necessity of conducting thorough testing and validation to ensure they are not adversely affecting society. From a legal standpoint, the application of CNNs, especially in sensitive areas like surveillance, demands a nuanced approach to balancing security needs with individual privacy rights.
                                        </p>
