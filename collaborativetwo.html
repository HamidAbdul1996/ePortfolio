									<h3>Read/listen to the article by Hutson (2021) in Nature on Robo-writers. This week, post your thoughts on the risks and benefits of the use AI writers at different levels, from administrative work to creative writing.</h3>
									<h4><u>Initial Post</u></h4>
									<p>
                                        For clerical and administrative work, I think AI writers can be very useful. By automating repetitive and low-risk tasks, they free up valuable time for workers. Tasks that once took hours, like analysing and summarising documents, can now be completed in mere minutes. However, I think it's important to implement stringent safeguards for AI-generated summaries, especially in areas with significant impact on human lives, such as judicial decisions or health diagnoses. Recently, The Courts and Tribunals Judiciary in England and Wales have given cautious approval to use AI in writing legal opinions (AP news, 2024) but stressed it shouldn’t be used for research or legal analyses because the technology can fabricate information and provide misleading, inaccurate biased information as mentioned by Hutson (2021).  
                                        Creative writing presents a more nuanced scenario. I think AI, as a tool to assist writers, holds great potential for sparking creativity, offering prompts, and guiding exploratory thinking. I use AI frequently to provide creative direction. Ippolito et al. (2022) highlight how AI-powered writing assistants, such as Wordcraft, support professional writers in creative tasks including brainstorming, story detail generation, and world-building. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that AI should not wholly replace our creative thought and critical reasoning. Relying too much on AI could foster a tendency towards intellectual laziness and inadvertently lead to plagiarism. Ippolito et al. (2022) also point out the challenges in maintaining an author's unique style and voice when using AI tools. I think the future of prompt engineering and its potential to craft a unique voice for AI is intriguing. Put very simply, LLMs learn patterns and relationships in language to generate coherent text based on statistical probabilities but the prospect of AI authors developing their own distinctive tones and emotional depth in writing is fascinating, if not a bit surreal. I wonder how as AI evolves, its capacity to not just mimic but also innovate in creative writing could redefine the boundaries of the craft.
                                        One final key aspect of AI in writing I think is important is its significant support for English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writers, particularly in idea development and articulating thoughts in written English. This is especially relevant in academic settings, where the quality of academic writing is often assessed. AI tools, like Wordtune, have been recognised for their utility in aiding EFL students in crafting more effective and coherent academic texts. Zhang (2022) specifically highlights this benefit, underscoring AI's role in bridging language gaps and enhancing communication skills.

                                        <p>
                                            Thanks for your insightful post, Shaun.
                                            You raise an interesting point about job creation/destruction. In my opinion, this is the nature of technological advancement. It makes us work more efficiently but the cost is that it displaces workers and makes certain jobs obsolete. This is the core principle of ‘Creative Destruction’, a term coined by Joseph Schumpeter describing the process through which innovation leads to the demise of older industries or structures. This represents the dynamic nature of capitalism (Schumpeter, 1942).
                                            I think many people have a natural desire to conserve these industries, but I think this is generally futile. Echoing Schumpeter, the process of creative destruction does indeed leave behind a trail of economic upheaval, but it simultaneously serves as the bedrock of human progress. The displacement of jobs is a pressing concern, and it may appear as though more positions are being eliminated than created however I think we are in a transitional phase where the widespread understanding and integration of AI into society is still evolving. As the general public becomes more adept at harnessing AI, I envision people playing a central role in successful AI use and roles will change. Businesses will be tasked with upskilling their workforce to navigate AI effectively, acknowledging that certain roles, particularly in clerical and administrative sectors, may become obsolete.

                                             <p>
                                                Thank you for your insightful post, Daisy. 
                                                You've touched on a critical issue regarding AI's role in journalism and the potential for disseminating false information. Indeed, the ability of AI to generate misinformation rapidly and flood the internet poses a significant challenge. Given the volume and the convincing nature of AI-produced content, discerning authenticity, particularly on social media, becomes increasingly difficult. Instances like News Corp's use of generative AI to produce 3,000 Australian news stories weekly, and CNET's experience in January 2023, where AI-generated articles were found to contain numerous errors, highlight this problem (The Guardian, 2023). These examples underscore the urgent need for enhanced safeguards and accountability measures in AI's application. I'm keen to hear your thoughts on how we might better navigate these challenges.
                                                I agree with Michael Bugeja (2023) from poynter.org in that newsrooms should temper their use of chatbots, hire more copy editors and emphasise fact-checking more than ever. It's crucial to bear in mind that Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT primarily generate predictions about language rather than relying on verifiable facts. This characteristic can lead to outputs that are incorrect yet presented with apparent confidence, a phenomenon often referred to as "AI hallucinations.

                                                <h4><u>Summary Post</u></h4>
                                                <p> 
                                                    Summary Post
                                                Upon reflecting on my original post and the feedback from my peers, there appears to be a consensus around the idea that AI writers will take over administrative and clerical tasks. As I mentioned in one of my posts, this transition can be viewed as a part of the natural evolution of technology, echoing the concept of creative destruction as introduced by Joseph Schumpeter (1942). 
                                                My peers also highlighted the issue of bias in AI, noting that it can perpetuate the underrepresentation of certain groups because it learns from existing datasets. Furthermore, there is a shared understanding that AI applications with profound implications on human lives, such as health diagnostics and judicial decisions, must be subject to rigorous safeguards to mitigate potential harms (AP News, 2024 & Norori et al, 2021).
                                                My peers also discussed the potential impact of AI on the job market, a point with which I agree. However, I believe we are currently navigating a transitional phase, where the widespread understanding and integration of AI into society is still evolving. As the general public becomes more adept at harnessing AI, I envision people playing a central role in successful AI use and roles will change. Businesses will be tasked with upskilling their workforce to navigate AI effectively, acknowledging that certain roles, particularly in clerical and administrative sectors, may become obsolete.
                                                In our discussions on AI writers and creative writing, we collectively touched upon some thought-provoking aspects. My peers highlighted concerns about AI writers diminishing the warmth and nuance characteristic of human interaction, a viewpoint I share. Nevertheless, the prospect of AI writers developing their distinctive tones remains an intriguing possibility. However, as one peer rightly pointed out, this raises complex questions regarding the ownership of content produced by AI (Karamolegkou, 2023). Determining who holds the rights to material generated by these technologies will certainly present significant challenges in the future!

                                                </p>
                                                    <h4><u>Reflection</u></h4>
                                                    <p> While each field presents its own set of challenges, there are several recurring issues made clear in our collaborative discussions that all machine learning professionals ought to be aware of and address. These are bias, data ownership, and accountability. One of the most pressing concerns is around how machine learning systems can perpetuate and exacerbate societal biases. I work in the public sector, and there was a concerning instance recently where an AI tool intended for benefits administration displayed potential bias. The tool was used to identify suspected benefits fraud and flagged a significant number of Bulgarian nationals consequently leading to the suspension of their benefits. Often on review, no evidence of fraud would be found (The Guardian, 2023). Now the Department of Works and Pensions maintains that the AI does not consider nationality but given the self-learning nature of these algorithms and the black box, it is difficult to determine precisely how they process and weigh the data they receive and how these might be perpetuating bias, and this is a point all machine learning professionals should be aware of and compelled to address.</p>
